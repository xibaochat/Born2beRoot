  The objective of this project is to set up a server on a Virtual Machine from scatch. The student needs to choose an operating system from the most two well-known Linux-based OS and then install services to build a fully functional and stricted-ruled system
  At the end of this project we should be fully comfortable with the concept of Virtualization, as well as dealing with command-line based systems, partitioning memory with LVM, setting up SSH ports, MACs, Firewalls, among many other important concepts. As the name of the project suggests: we come to realize that we are, indeed, born to be root.
